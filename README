NAME
    Stardust - a simple and pure-Perl PSGI/Plack HTTP server with pre-forks

SYNOPSIS
      $ plackup -s Stardust --port=80 [options] your-app.psgi

      $ plackup -s Stardust --port=443 --ssl=1 --ssl-key-file=file.key --ssl-cert-file=file.crt [options] your-app.psgi

      $ plackup -s Stardust --port=80 --ipv6 [options] your-app.psgi

      $ plackup -s Stardust --socket=/tmp/stardust.sock [options] your-app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
    Stardust is a standalone HTTP/1.1 server with keep-alive support. It
    uses pre-forking. It is pure-Perl implementation which doesn't require
    any XS package.

NOTES
    Stardust was started as a fork of Thrall server which is a fork of
    Starlet server. It has almost the same code as Thrall and Starlet and it
    was adapted to doesn't use any other modules than Plack.

SEE ALSO
    Thrall, Starlet, Starman

LIMITATIONS
    Perl on Windows systems (MSWin32 and cygwin) emulates fork and waitpid
    functions and uses threads internally. See perlfork (MSWin32) and
    perlcygwin (cygwin) for details and limitations.

    It might be better option to use on this system the server with explicit
    threads implementation, i.e. Thrall.

    For Cygwin the `perl-libwin32' package is highly recommended, because of
    Win32::Process module which helps to terminate stalled worker processes.

BUGS
    There is a problem with Perl threads implementation which occurs on
    Windows. Some requests can fail with message:

      failed to set socket to nonblocking mode:An operation was attempted on
      something that is not a socket.

    or

      Bad file descriptor at (eval 24) line 4.

    Cygwin version seems to be correct.

    This problem was introduced in Perl 5.16 and fixed in Perl 5.19.5.
