# NAME

Stardust - a simple and pure-Perl PSGI/Plack HTTP server with pre-forks

# SYNOPSIS

    $ plackup -s Stardust --port=80 [options] your-app.psgi

    $ plackup -s Stardust --port=443 --ssl=1 --ssl-key-file=file.key --ssl-cert-file=file.crt [options] your-app.psgi

    $ plackup -s Stardust --port=80 --ipv6 [options] your-app.psgi

    $ plackup -s Stardust --socket=/tmp/stardust.sock [options] your-app.psgi

# DESCRIPTION

Stardust is a standalone HTTP/1.1 server with keep-alive support. It uses
pre-forking. It is pure-Perl implementation which doesn't require any XS
package.

# COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

In addition to the options supported by [plackup](https://metacpan.org/pod/plackup), Stardust accepts following
options(s).

- \--max-workers=\#

    number of worker processes (default: 10)

- \--timeout=\#

    seconds until timeout (default: 300)

- \--keepalive-timeout=\#

    timeout for persistent connections (default: 2)

- \--max-keepalive-reqs=\#

    max. number of requests allowed per single persistent connection.  If set to
    one, persistent connections are disabled (default: 1)

- \--max-reqs-per-child=\#

    max. number of requests to be handled before a worker process exits (default:
    1000)

- \--min-reqs-per-child=\#

    if set, randomizes the number of requests handled by a single worker process
    between the value and that supplied by `--max-reqs-per-chlid` (default: none)

- \--spawn-interval=\#

    if set, worker processes will not be spawned more than once than every given
    seconds.  Also, when SIGHUP is being received, no more than one worker
    processes will be collected every given seconds.  This feature is useful for
    doing a "slow-restart". (default: none)

- \--main-process-delay=\#

    the Stardust does not synchronize its processes and it requires a small delay in
    main process so it doesn't consume all CPU. (default: 0.1)

- \--ssl=\#

    enables SSL support. The [IO::Socket::SSL](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Socket::SSL) module is required. (default: 0)

- \--ssl-key-file=\#

    specifies the path to SSL key file. (default: none)

- \--ssl-cert-file=\#

    specifies the path to SSL certificate file. (default: none)

- \--ipv6=\#

    enables IPv6 support. The [IO::Socket::IP](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Socket::IP) module is required. (default: 0)

- \--socket=\#

    enables UNIX socket support. The [IO::Socket::UNIX](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Socket::UNIX) module is required. The
    socket file have to be not yet created. The first character `@` or `\0` in
    the socket file name means that abstract socket address will be created.
    (default: none)

# NOTES

Stardust was started as a fork of [Thrall](https://metacpan.org/pod/Thrall) server which is a fork of
[Starlet](https://metacpan.org/pod/Starlet) server. It has almost the same code as [Thrall](https://metacpan.org/pod/Thrall) and [Starlet](https://metacpan.org/pod/Starlet) and
it was adapted to doesn't use any other modules than [Plack](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack).

# LIMITATIONS

The Windows systems doesn't support pre-forking servers.
