=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ plackup -s Stardust --port=80 [options] your-app.psgi

  $ plackup -s Stardust --port=443 --ssl=1 --ssl-key-file=file.key --ssl-cert-file=file.crt [options] your-app.psgi

  $ plackup -s Stardust --port=80 --ipv6 [options] your-app.psgi

  $ plackup -s Stardust --socket=/tmp/stardust.sock [options] your-app.psgi

  $ stardust your-app.psgi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

In addition to the options supported by L<plackup>, Stardust accepts following
options(s).

=over

=item --max-workers=#

number of worker processes (default: 10)

=item --timeout=#

seconds until timeout (default: 300)

=item --keepalive-timeout=#

timeout for persistent connections (default: 2)

=item --max-keepalive-reqs=#

max. number of requests allowed per single persistent connection.  If set to
one, persistent connections are disabled (default: 1)

=item --max-reqs-per-child=#

max. number of requests to be handled before a worker process exits (default:
1000)

=item --min-reqs-per-child=#

if set, randomizes the number of requests handled by a single worker process
between the value and that supplied by C<--max-reqs-per-chlid> (default: none)

=item --spawn-interval=#

if set, worker processes will not be spawned more than once than every given
seconds.  Also, when SIGHUP is being received, no more than one worker
processes will be collected every given seconds.  This feature is useful for
doing a "slow-restart". (default: none)

=item --main-process-delay=#

the Stardust does not synchronize its processes and it requires a small delay in
main process so it doesn't consume all CPU. (default: 0.1)

=item --ssl=#

enables SSL support. The L<IO::Socket::SSL> module is required. (default: 0)

=item --ssl-key-file=#

specifies the path to SSL key file. (default: none)

=item --ssl-cert-file=#

specifies the path to SSL certificate file. (default: none)

=item --ipv6=#

enables IPv6 support. The L<IO::Socket::IP> module is required. (default: 0)

=item --socket=#

enables UNIX socket support. The L<IO::Socket::UNIX> module is required. The
socket file have to be not yet created. The first character C<@> or C<\0> in
the socket file name means that abstract socket address will be created.
(default: none)

=head1 NOTES

Stardust was started as a fork of L<Thrall> server which is a fork of
L<Starlet> server. It has almost the same code as L<Thrall> and L<Starlet> and
it was adapted to doesn't use any other modules than L<Plack>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Thrall>,
L<Starlet>,
L<Starman>

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Perl on Windows systems (MSWin32 and cygwin) emulates fork and waitpid functions
and uses threads internally. See L<perlfork> (MSWin32) and L<perlcygwin>
(cygwin) for details and limitations.

It might be better option to use on this system the server with explicit threads
implementation, i.e. L<Thrall>.

For Cygwin the C<perl-libwin32> package is highly recommended, because of
L<Win32::Process> module which helps to terminate stalled worker processes.

=head1 BUGS

There is a problem with Perl threads implementation which occurs on Windows
systems (MSWin32). Cygwin version seems to be correct.

Some requests can fail with message:

  failed to set socket to nonblocking mode:An operation was attempted on
  something that is not a socket.

or

  Bad file descriptor at (eval 24) line 4.

This problem was introduced in Perl 5.16 and fixed in Perl 5.19.5.

See L<https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=119003> and

issue.

Harakiri mode fails with message:

  Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x293a76c, Perl interpreter:
  0x22dcc0c at lib/Plack/Handler/Stardust.pm line 140.
